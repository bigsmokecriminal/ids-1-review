    "In this Jupyter notebook, please, document your results and the way you have obtained them. You can use the attached yaml file to build Python environment for this assignment. Another option (and the easiest way) is to just use the _Python environment_ provided at the beginning of the course and then use *pip install* to install *p_decision_tree* library. You can find the required yaml file in the folder of this assignment. In addition to the _Jupyter notebook_, please submit _one zip-file_ containing all datasets and other outputs you have generated (such as pdf, jpg, and others). Please make sure that the datasets and other outputs are easily identifiable, i.e. use names as requested in the corresponding question.\n",

    "\n",
    "Median:\\\n",
    "We see that the median is around 165 and 164. As median splits the data set into 50/50, we can say that removing outliners of `AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY` has and greater impact on `ARRIVAL_DELAY` than outliners of `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY`. Also we can say that the outliners of `AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY` must more related to `ARRIVAL_DELAY >= 165` since removing them reduced our median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean:\\\n",
    "Here we have a similar observation. But we can now say that `AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY` and `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` tend to relate to flights that have a flight `ARRIVAL_DELAY > 181` since removing them decreases our mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mode:\\\n",
    "Mode is the value that occurs the most in the data sets. We can see that 121 still stays the mode. Based on that we conclude that both `AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY` (more) and `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` (less) dont relate to this `ARRIVAL_DELAY` significantly which coincide with our first to observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Std:\\\n",
    "The difference in the std shows that when dropping outliners of `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` the spread of data decreases, while dropping outliners of `AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY` the spread of data increases. We think that this can give a hint on how `ARRIVAL_DELAY` relates to these features. For `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` we think that the outliners correspond to `ARRIVAL_DELAY` outside of the std range (mainly bigger than ≈ 181+55) because the std decreases. Interestingly this does not apply to the outliners of `AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY`. They also often relate to `ARRIVAL_DELAY`s inside the std range ≈ (181-55, 181+55). \n",
    "\n",
    "Var:\\\n",
    "It is just std squared. We wont interpret this since we already did!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** \\\n",
    "Removing possible delays of a flight improves the average flight delay. This is not surprising! But we found out that `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` tend occur less (see size) but correlates to quite big `ARRIVAL_DELAY`s outside the std range (see decrease of std). This kind of makes sense since an airplane has to be checked, fueled and boarded which are processes that are already on a tight schedule to save money! Therefore having an late airplane can cause bigger delays flights with that airplane while `AIR_SYSTEM_DELAY`s fankly happens more often (see size) but can be sometimes can be compensated and result in delays inside our std range. This also checks out as traffic controllers will be instructed to adapt to new situations and coordinates the airplanes."

    "For EV as one can see: extreme long arrival delays (eg. >550min) the impact of weather delays are (almost) negligible as they are almost always close to 0. Now for arrival delays >360 min (and below 550min) we can see that most of the arrival delays are not caused by weather delays because most late flights have in fact 0 weather delay, but we can see that there is an almost linear increase of weather delay time between 360min and 500min which in total matches the arrival delay! So if you have a delay cause by weather which takes long to resolve(>360min), than your arrival delay in total tend to be mainly cause by that weather delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "For VX it is hard to give a sophisticated interpretation as only few data is available. we can observe a similar behavior as above in regards that only flights with a releatively small arrival delay (in sense that they already have a arrival delay > 360min) have been partly caused by weather conditions. But here we cannot say that the total arrival delay is likely to be caused by the weather conditions! Also the majority of flights with arrival delay >360min have a weather delay of 0!\n"

    "You heard from a friend that you are entitled to receive a payment of at least 150€ if your flight is delayed by more than 3 hours. Very excited, you are reminded of your IDS course and the flight dataset you had to analyze back then. You start to imagine a model trained on these flights that can predict if your future flights are delayed by three hours and, basically, allow you to travel the world for free if it chooses these flights correctly. You remember your IDS lecture and what you have to do to make your dream come true: You want to prepare the data accordingly, i.e., you model the target variable of being delayed by more than 3 hours and you choose and model the descriptive variable that you want to use for predicting delay. For the evaluation of your models, you have to choose an evaluation metric that describes whether the flights chosen by your model are actually delayed by <b> at least </b> 3 hours. Moreover, for the models, you want to train different regression, SVM, and neural network models with different parameters and find the best one. In the end, you should calculate for which flight price your model lets you travel the world for free.\n",

    "k means clustering is an NP hard problem. So to efficiently solve it we can use heuristic algorithmns to at least find a local maximum! The goal is to create k clusters with elements having smallest difference to their centroid. With that in mind it is clear why different random centroids can help solving this problem. Choosing different centroids can help to algorithmn to converge quickier. Also depending on the data, different initializazion of the centroids will lead to different clusterings which sometimes even perform differently. Therefore different initialization of centroids can lead to different optimums for which one of them might be the global optimum. This is not guaranteed tho, however much better than (and of course it would make more sense) than running the cluster algorithmn 5 times with the same centroids which than would give us the same result (optimum everytime)!

    "Having a much longer air time than planned is not mainly caused by weather or late aircraft delays! We can clearly see that flights with much longer `AIR_TIME_DELAY` have an relatively small weather and late aircraft delay. \n",
    "\n",
    "Going to the next cluster(c2) we see that suddenly `WEATHER_DELAY` correspond to small air time delay while the mean of `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` only increases by a really small amount. This tells us that while our flight has low `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` having really high weather delay tend to increase the `AIR_TIME_DELAY` slightly. Having a high weather delay will often occur in extreme weather situations. Here flying faster might not always be an option due to safety...\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the next cluster(c3) we see that having slightly less air time than planned actually relates to high `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` while `WEATHER_DELAY`is small. This totally make sense since low `WEATHER_DELAY` indicates that the weather conditions are good. This way the pilot could possibly fly faster to compensate high `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` and so reduce the air time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar observations can be seen in cluster c4-c5. Here we have small `WEATHER_DELAY`s and medium to small `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY`s which relates to negative `AIR_TIME_DELAY`. \n",
    "\n",
    "One more interesting fact is that many flights (0.48) have an negative `AIR_TIME_DELAY`. While having a `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` will motivate the pilot to go faster (0.64 have that delay), having a even small `WEATHER_DELAY` seems to reduce the amount of flights flying faster significantly (only 0.05 will have a reduced air time). About one third (0.35) of the faster flights don't even have an `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY`. So saying that having `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` is the only motivation to travel faster is wrong!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we look into the flights that had longer air time (0.49), we can see they actually often have no `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` and `AIR_TIME_DELAY` at all (0.56)! This coincide with our first observation that `LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY` and `WEATHER_DELAY` are not the \n",
    "main reasons for longer air time. Actually we can see that only 0.07 of slower airplanes suffer `WEATHER_DELAY`! This is a little bit contractictory as cluster c2 might imply that `WEATHER_DELAY` relates to slower airplanes while this cluster actually only consists of extrem weather situations/delays! Here we can see that it is always important to look into different metrics and statistics before making statements!\n"
